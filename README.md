Bias correction methods that have been adopted in this training manual have been developed by SWAAT Project Research Group at the University of Arizona, Tucson. For this training purpose, all available resources have been recoded and translated into open source programming platform by Begum Rabeya Rushi, Regional Science Associate of NASA Science Coordination Office. Faith Mithue, Thematic Lead, Water Resources & Disasters RCMRD, SERVIR-Eastern and Southern Africa a  and Stella Masese, Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) supported co-ordination effort to organize the bias correction of satellite products training. Lee Ellenburg, Eric Anderson, Emily Adams, Africa Flores of NASA SCO provided time-to-time feedback to improve the training materials.
