For this training purpose, all available resources have been recoded and translated into open source programming platform by SERVIR SCO. Faith Mithue, Thematic Lead, Water Resources & Disasters RCMRD, SERVIR-Eastern and Southern Africa a  and Stella Masese, Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) supported co-ordination effort to organize the bias correction of satellite products training. Lee Ellenburg, regional science coordinator for SERVIR Hindu Kush-Himalaya and Eric Anderson, Emily Adams, regional science associate for SERVIR Eastern and Southern Africa, Africa Flores, regional science coordinator of SERVIR East and Southern Africa, regional science coordinator for SERVIR Mekong provided time-to-time feedback to improve the training materials.
